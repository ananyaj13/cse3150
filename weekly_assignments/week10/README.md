## Steps:
### Note: my fuel efficiency functions are split up into a costOfFuel function and a MilesPerDollar function, so it's essentially the same thing, but called different things, for the Vehicle class, it's just called costOfFuel. For the hybrid class, I used the professor's starter code as reference, and so I still have the start and stop funcions though not required
1. download week10 folder
